He thinks that he's a martyr\nBut the meaner that he tries to act just makes us all laugh harder\nThe best alternative that I see for him to vent his rage\nIs to give him Samsonite luggage and lock him in a cave"

The angels of Valhalla perform their timeless number, perhaps soothing the great, saddened hero. And, well, one of his hammer?
